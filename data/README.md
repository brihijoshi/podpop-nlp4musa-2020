# Data

## Accessing raw transcripts

The labels and IDs of the podcasts are present in `popularity_train.txt` and `popularity_test.txt`. For instructions on downloading the raw transcripts and data descriptions, we refer you to [Longqi Yang's repository](https://github.com/ylongqi/podcast-data-modeling#data-descriptions).

We also acknowledge Yang and other authors for making their dataset publicly accessible without which this project would not have been possible.
